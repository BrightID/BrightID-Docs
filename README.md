# ðŸ”† BrightID

BrightID is a privacy-first social identity network that allows you to prove to applications that you are accessing them fairly with only one account.

Each person holds a BrightID and makes connections with people that know them. A graph is formed with their BrightID and their connections and fake BrightIDs are detected by analyzing the graph.

BrightID is a stepping stone to create a fair digital world for all citizens of the world.
