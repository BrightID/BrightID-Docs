# ðŸ”† BrightID

BrightID lets apps make sure their users don't have multiple accounts so that everyone has a fair share and a better experience.

Each person has an account on BrightID and makes connections with people they know. A graph is formed with the accounts and their connections and fake accounts are detected by analyzing the graph.

BrightID is a stepping stone to create a fair digital world for all citizens of the world.
