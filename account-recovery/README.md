# üîê Account Recovery

**Social Recovery** is a great way to recover if you have three or more close family or friends who would not mind being your recovery connection. It can be quite effective:

* It is not necessary for your recovery connections to have any verification.
* It does not cost an extra phone (unlike device recovery).

**Device Recovery** is great if you do not have anybody suitable to be your recovery connection. You can use _additional_ phone(s) as secondary backup(s) of your BrightID.

Learn more about each and set one or both up as early as possible to never lose your BrightID.
