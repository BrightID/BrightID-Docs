# Forum

The first step in using Bright DAO is to join discussions. Go to [the forum](https://forum.brightid.org/) and click "Sign up."

The "with Discord" option on the right is the easiest way if you're already a member of [our Discord](https://discord.gg/42rARh4Bqb).

### Proposals and Ideas

Ideas for new proposals can be created as forum posts under the [BrightDAO + Ideas category](https://forum.brightid.org/c/bright-dao/ideas/8) to invite feedback from the community.

Once a proposal is created in the DAO, the corresponding topic in the forum can be assigned to the “Proposals” category after enough detail is added that voters know exactly what they're being asked to support.
