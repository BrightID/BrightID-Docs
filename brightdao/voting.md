# Voting

As a $BRIGHT holder, you can vote on initiatives in [BrightDAO](https://dao.brightid.org). Voting doesn’t use up your tokens--in fact you can earn rewards as you hold $BRIGHT and participate in voting.

‌Here are examples of initiatives you can support through your vote:‌

* Research and development teams
* Community-building efforts
* $BRIGHT liquidity reward pools
* Hackathons
* Educating and supporting users
* Public relations
* Tools to help power-users identify honest and dishonest regions in the BrightID graph.

You will need $BRIGHT to create a proposal or support existing proposals.
