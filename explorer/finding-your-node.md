# Finding Your Node

To find your node in the BrightID graph, you need to log in to the explorer with your BrightID. This can be done by scanning the QR code that is shown on the explorer using your BrightID mobile application and adding the explorer to the devices list.&#x20;

When you log in to the explorer, your node gets selected automatically and the view of the graph zooms on your node. Your own and your connectionsâ€™ photos are shown on corresponding graph nodes. You can also find the names of your connections in the top menu and select them to find their locations in the graph and their detailed information in the left menu.
