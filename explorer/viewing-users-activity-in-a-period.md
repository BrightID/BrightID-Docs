# Viewing Users Activity in a Period

Users’ activity in a specific period can be visualized using the “Users Activity Illustrator.” When “From” and “To” times are selected, the play button can be pressed to start viewing connections that are made in each period one step at a time. The period is a day if “From” and “To” are different days, and an hour or a minute if “From” and “To” have the same day or hour. The playing speed can be slowed down by increasing “Delay between steps.”

A sub-graph that is created from only those connections made in the defined period can also be viewed using the “Sub-graph” button. To return back from the sub-graph to the complete graph, the “Reset” button on the top menu can be used.
