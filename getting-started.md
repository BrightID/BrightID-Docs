# âœ¨ Getting Started

If you have not installed BrightID mobile app already, please install it:

* [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brightid/id1428946820)
* Android
  * [PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.brightid)

Unlike other identity verification systems, BrightID does not require or record any personally identifying information from your offline or online life. You do not need to submit your national ID, phone number, date of birth, home address, or biometric data. Nor your email, social media accounts, or blockchain wallets. Here is a post that explains how [BrightID is _not_ KYC like the way it is generally known. In many ways, it is an alternative principally opposed to it](https://twitter.com/BrightIDProject/status/1587769127338319872).\

All you need is to provide a picture and a name of your choice, only to facilitate making connections so that people that know you do not get confused. You can even change them at any time as long as your connections recognize you. They are not even recorded in BrightID's network infrastructure. They are only recorded on your and your close connection's devices and nowhere else on the internet for the sake of privacy. You share them securely via a p2p channel when you make connections with your friends and that's it. That means you are as private as the close connections you make and trust. There are simply no leakage of your personally identifying information from the infrastructure side as there are none of it there. The project takes privacy very seriously.

The home screen shows your name and picture. Your BrightID verification status is indicated under your name. In the initial condition when you have not received any verification badges, the status below your name will say 'Verifications: none'.

You can see your connections, achievements and apps. The buttons for making connections are at the bottom. The icons for the menu and notifications are at the top. You will receive notifications for incoming connection requests, group invites, and alert to setup recovery. IMPORTANT: Please pay close attention to the notifications and respond accordingly.\

The menu has features like editing your profile, seeing your achievements, checking for updates, and more.
