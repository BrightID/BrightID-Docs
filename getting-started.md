Unlike other ID verification systems, BrightID does not require or record any personally identifying information from your offline or online life. You do not need to submit your National ID number, date of birth, proof of address, or biometric data.\
\
All you need is to provide a picture and a name of your choice to facilitate making connections so that people that know you do not get confused. You can even change them at any time. They are recorded only on your and your close connection's devices and nowhere else on the internet. You share them securely via a p2p channel when you make connections with your friends.

The home screen shows your name and picture. Your BrightID verification status is indicated under your name. In a condition when you're not verified for any application, the status bar will said 'unverified'.
