# âœ¨ Getting Started

Unlike other ID verification systems, BrightID does not require or record any personally identifying information from your offline or online life. You do not need to submit your National ID number, date of birth, proof of address, or biometric data.\
\
All you need is to provide a picture and a name of your choice to facilitate making connections so that people that know you do not get confused. You can even change them at any time. They are recorded only on your and your close connection's devices and nowhere else on the internet. You share them securely via a p2p channel when you make connections with your friends. That means you are as private as the close connections you make and trust. Besides that there are no leakage of your personally identifying information from the infrastructure side as there are none there.

The home screen shows your name and picture. Your BrightID verification status is indicated under your name. In the initial condition when you have not received any verification badges, the status below your name will say 'Verifications: none'.

You can see your connections, groups and apps. The buttons for making connections are at the bottom. The icons for the menu and notifications are at the top. You will receive notifications for incoming connection requests, group invites, and alert to setup recovery. Please pay close attention to them and respond accordingly.\
\
The menu has features like editing your profile, seeing your achievements, checking for updates, and more.
