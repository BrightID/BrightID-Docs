Unlike other ID verification tools, BrightID requires no ID number, date of birth, or proof of address. All you need to provide is a picture and a name of your choice to facilitate making connections and other activities. You can even change them at any time.

Your name and picture are saved only on your own device and nowhere else on the internet. You share them securely via a p2p channel when you make connections with your friends.
