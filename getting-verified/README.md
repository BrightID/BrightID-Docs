# ðŸŸ  Getting Verified

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Getting Started\_P3 (1).png>)

You will get verified on BrightID based on your social relationships and the communities you belong to. These are presented to BrightID with your connections and the groups you create or join.

There are different levels of verification on BrightID. The first level of verification can be achieved by joining a [**verification party**](http://meet.brightid.org/) and following the instructions that are provided by the hosts. But that is only the beginning. Some apps might require you to have higher verification levels like getting verified in [Bitu](bitu-verification.md).
