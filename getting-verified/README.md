# ðŸŸ  BrightID Verifications

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Getting Started\_P3 (1).png>)

You will receive verification badges on your BrightID based on your social relationships. The relationships are represented in BrightID network infrastructure as a social graph of anonymous connections to determine which particular kind of verification badge you can receive. See [Making Connections](../making-connections.md) to make connections to your close relationships.

There are different levels of verification on BrightID. The first level of verification can be achieved by joining a [**verification party**](http://meet.brightid.org/) and following the instructions that are provided by the hosts. But that is only the beginning. Some apps might require you to have higher verification levels like getting verified in [Bitu](bitu-verification.md).
