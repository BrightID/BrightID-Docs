# ðŸŸ  Receive Verifications

You receive verification badges on your BrightID based on connections you make with your BrightID. The connections are represented in BrightID network infrastructure as an anonymous social graph. It is analyzed through each of the verification protocols to determine which kind of badges you are able to receive. If you do not have any, the app will say "Verifications: none".\
\
Furthermore, different apps require you to have different verification badges. So far most of them check if you have the Meets verification on your BrightID.

There are three kinds of verifications, two of which are complete(Meets and Bitu) and one is under development(Aura).

1. Meets verification
2. [Bitu verification](bitu-verification.md)
3. Aura verifications
