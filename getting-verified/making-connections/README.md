# ü§ù Making Connections

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/making Connection\_P1.png>)

Your BrightID is verified based on the social relationships that you present with your connections. Use the buttons on the bottom of the home screen to start making connections. One person shows a QR code for the other one to scan. The profiles data will then be exchanged through a secure p2p channel. They will then select the level of connections based on how much they know each other. It might be ‚Äúalready known‚Äù, ‚Äújust met‚Äù, or ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù.

If a group of people want to make connections at the same time, it is more convenient to make a group connection in which one person shows a QR code and everyone else scans it, so that everyone gets connected to each other.

To make a group connection, remember to change the ‚Äúsingle-use‚Äù QR to a ‚Äúgroup code‚Äù with the button on top. You will get notified each time someone scans the code. This code can be scanned by up to 30 people.

QR codes can also be shared as links using the ‚Äúcopy link‚Äù button. Each QR code or link is valid for 15 minutes.

What matters the most in making connections is selecting the right connection levels which are more detailed in the next section.
