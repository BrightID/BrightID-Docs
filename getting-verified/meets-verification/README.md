# Meets Verification

The Meets verification is the first and the most basic verification protocol BrightID project has had since the beginning. For a long time it has been the only verification.\
\
The social identity network of close relations that BrightID project set out to build had a cold start problem. The social graph needed to be seeded with people and relations. No existing social graphs fit the bill, so Meets protocol was built. While BrightID was never meant to settle on the verification, it is still the widely used verification. The characteristic verification parties that is part of the protocol is what most people know BrightID by.\
\
The protocol works with the member of the public making a connection with one of the special set of people called Hosts. Internally the protocol calls them Seeds. "Seed" actually shows up as a special kind of badge in the Host's BrightID. Anybody that makes a "just met" connection with the host receives the Meets verification. Only one connection is enough.\
\
In practice, Hosts hold connection parties over zoom at a more or less regular [schedule](https://meet.brightid.org) so that the member of the public can make connection with the host. All meetings are open to join at the scheduled time and remain open to join only for 5 minutes.

## What does the public need to do in the connection meeting?

The protocol requires that the member of the public _show_ themselves clearly on video. They also need to _listen_ carefully and _respond_ sensibly if the host asks them to respond. If there is no response, or the response is not sensible, host refuses to make connection with them. So, it is important for the member of the public to either attend meeting in the language they understand and speak well, or they need to take a human translator who can help them listen and respond appropriately during the meeting.

[Meetings are available in select languages.\

[Making connection](../making-connections/) is same as connecting with one's close connections. Host presents connection QR code over video which can be scanned with BrightID mobile app, or alternatively a link is presented that initiates the connection if one is attending meeting with a mobile phone.\
\
After a successful meeting and connection, it takes about half an hour for the member of the public to receive the Meets verification badge. It shows up as a badge under their profile name in BrightID app.
