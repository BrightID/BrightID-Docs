# Claim Your Eidi Supply

Visit [https://idchain.one/begin/](https://idchain.one/begin/) and follow the steps.

If you have already set up your BrightID and got it verified, you could skip 1, 2 and 3. [User Tutorial](https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/begin-your-journey-here) also helps you with those steps.

Provide your ethereum address in step 4. You could either use the "Load From Metamask" button or paste the address manually in the provided bar.

Your Eidi supply will be sent to your wallet shortly. You can check your supply in your metamask. Make sure to set your network to IDChain.\

Each Eidi will support thousands of transactions.   &#x20;
