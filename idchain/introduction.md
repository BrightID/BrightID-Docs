# Introduction

IDChain ([IDChain.one](https://explorer.idchain.one)) is a [proof-of-authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof\_of\_authority) blockchain where validators are democratically elected by [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org)-verified unique humans.

## Features

* Short block intervals.
* Every verified unique human gets a lifetime supply (average) of gas.
* Validators (the proof-of-authority equivalent to miners) can be democratically elected.
* Validators get paid a modest salary by [BrightID Main DAO](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Constitution).
* Gas fees are burned.

## What can I do with IDChain?

### Launch a cheap Aragon DAO <a href="#64bd" id="64bd"></a>

BrightID and IDChain itself use [DAOs](https://blockchainhub.net/dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization/) on IDChain for governance. You can start making [Aragon DAOs](https://aragon.idchain.one/#/) at [aragon.idchain.one](https://aragon.idchain.one/) with your lifetime supply of Eidi.

### Move DAI between Mainnet and IDChain <a href="#7a70" id="7a70"></a>

Weâ€™ve implemented the excellent bridge from [PoA](https://bridge.poa.net/) to create a way to move [DAI stablecoin](https://makerdao.com/en/) between Mainnet and IDChain. The bridge is at [dai.idchain.one](https://dai.idchain.one/).

## **Eidi**

Eidi is the native gas token on IDChain (similar to Ether on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)). The lifetime supply is designated by validators to match what they believe an average user will spend on transaction fees. If a user spends more, they need to buy Eidi from a user that spends less.
