# ‚¨Ü Update recovery connections

People you trust come and go away from your life from time to time. You can change your recovery connections by:

1. Adding another connection to your recovery connection, Or
2. Changing the connection level of the existing connection on the Recovery Connection page.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For your security, changes on recovery connections will take effect only **after seven days.**\
\
The period is called the cool-down period, and it helps if someone deliberately steals your mobile phone to steal your BrightID by changing your recovery connections. It allows you to recover your BrightID to a new mobile phone before they do.\
\
As mentioned before, BrightID on the stolen or old mobile phone automatically becomes invalidated and useless when you recover to a new mobile phone.
{% endhint %}
