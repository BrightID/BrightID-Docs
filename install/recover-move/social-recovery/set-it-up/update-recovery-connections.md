# Update recovery connections

The way of life is that the our close relationships changes from time to time. If we are healthy about our relationships we usually keep our relationships of interdependence longer. It is also the case that only people we trust can betray us. Just because of that, trusting nobody is no way for a social being to live their life. So, it is important to be able to curate and update our trusted relationships.\
\
When relationships do change, in BrightID we can change your recovery connections. By:

1. Adding another connection, Or
2. Changing the connection level of an existing connection.

{% hint style="info" %}
For your security, changes to recovery connections will take effect only **after seven days.**\
\
The period is called the cool-down period, and it helps if someone deliberately steals your mobile phone to steal your BrightID by changing your recovery connections. It allows you to recover your BrightID to a new mobile phone before they do.\
\
As will be mentioned again in [the recovery process](../recover.md) in the next section, for security, BrightID on the stolen or old mobile phone automatically becomes invalidated and useless when you recover to a new phone.
{% endhint %}
