# âœ… Connect to Apps

Apps use BrightID to keep fake accounts out and make sure that you get the most out of your unique identity. First, you need to be verified for each app in order to start using it. &#x20;

Once you are verified for each app, you can link it to your BrightID by scanning a QR code or using a link that is provided on that appâ€™s page. This will automatically open the apps page on BrightID and ask for your confirmation. The app will also recognize your BrightID after you confirm. None of your information whatsoever will be shared with apps. They will only get informed whether you are verified for using them.

You need to have your BrightID sponsored once by one app in order to use all apps for lifetime. If the app you want to use does not provide sponsorships, try getting your BrightID sponsored by another app first.

**Step 1:** Go to[ App Page](https://apps.brightid.org/) and click the website link of the applications you want to be linked to.
