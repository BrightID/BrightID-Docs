# ü§ù Making Connections

You receive verifications on your BrightID based on your close alliances. Verifications are a reflection of your relationships. If you do not have connections, there is nothing to reflect. So, by adopting BrightID as the public good to help you gain fair access to web3 properties, you are expected to make connections to people that mutually know you. It is also based on the principle that your identity should be attested and secured by people that actually know and care about you rather than some distant and central authority.\


### Making one-to-one connections

Use the buttons on the bottom of the home screen to start making connections. One person shows a QR code for the other one to scan. The corresponding profile data will then be exchanged through a secure p2p channel. They will then select the level of connections based on how much they know each other. It might be ‚Äúalready known‚Äù, ‚Äújust met‚Äù, or ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù. "Already known" being the desirable one for the verification protocols and security mechanism in BrightID.

### Making group connections

If a group of people want to make connections at the same time, it is more convenient to make a group connection in which one person shows a QR code and everyone else scans it, so that everyone gets connected to each other.

To make a group connection, remember to change the ‚Äúsingle-use‚Äù QR to a ‚Äúgroup code‚Äù with the button on top. You will get notified each time someone scans the code. This code can be scanned by up to 30 people.

QR codes can also be shared as links using the ‚Äúcopy link‚Äù button. Each QR code or link is valid for 15 minutes.

What matters the most in making connections is selecting the right connection levels which are more detailed in the next section.
