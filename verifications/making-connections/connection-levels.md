# ðŸ«‚ Connection Levels

The rule of thumb to follow as already described in the [Guidelines](./#guidelines) is simply not to make connection with random strangers that do not really know or care about you, or you them. Do not consent to such connection requests. BrightID as social identity network is not like other social networks where you follow anybody or anybody can follow you without mutual consent. In BrightID, always curate your connections carefully. As described in the guidelines, these mutual connections are stored anonymously in the social graph forever and there are risks to making untrusted connections. If you have not read the [Guidelines](./#guidelines), please read them again.

Having established that, there are 3 levels of connections in BrightID.

### Already know

Make connections only with people you know well enough to trust them. This might include family, friends, workplace colleagues, or people you have shared interests or goals with within different communities and organizations(IRL or virtual) you are a part of. If the Internet is big part of your life, it is likely you are a part of a close-knit community online if not more than one. Close connections there are also acceptable. It depends upon the level of kinship you feel with each other.

### Just met

Sometimes there are people you just met and would like for them to get to know you as you get to know them. They could turn into a close trusted connection, a friendship, as you do things together over a considerable period of time, or they may remain strangers or someone you do not trust. Use this connection level carefully. This can happen in various web3 communities, where you are limited by their digital presence, which is lower bandwidth presence than relationships in the physical world.

### Suspicious

Sometimes we are wrong about people we just met. The initial spark of connection you felt, dies, and you may find yourself wishing you never consented to make the connection. In this case, change the connection level below "Just met" and set it to "Suspicious".

You can also remove connections you do not want to see in your connections screen. However the anonymous connection between you and the person remains forever in the BrightID social graph.

So, it is critical that you curate your relationships with utmost honesty and care. Your curation and labeling helps verification protocols clean up duplicate account and strengthen the social identity network of unique digital citizens. Sophisticated and higher lever verification protocols rely on the connection level you set. It helps to keep out agents that try to ruin and deplete the value of web3 public properties by unfairly using multiple accounts to access them. The next section on apps provides more context on fair access from the perspective of the public as well as the apps.\
